written the main api app (project.py)
created a dockerfile so that it can be build upon the image "adana-weather". (command: docker build -t adana-weather)
once that is done with, we run the image with the command "docker run -p 8000:8000 adana-weather" to launch the api via container.
NOTE: I've specified the port in the commnd above since I experienced some trouple while launching.
